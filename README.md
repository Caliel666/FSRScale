NRLive is a Windows utility that captures a game or app window and presents it in a scaled output window with AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) and motion-based enhancements. It is built around a DXGI/D3D12 capture and presentation pipeline for Windows.

It is designed for situations where you want a source window to remain visible in a game or app while presenting a larger, more comfortable scaled view in a separate output surface.

## What it does

NRLive can:

- capture a target window
- display it in a configurable output overlay/window
- scale the captured content to a larger presentation window
- enable AMD FSR upscaling and frame generation
- support hotkeys for toggling the overlay, scaling, and stopping the app
- show a HUD for status, FPS, and capture state

The general idea is simple: a small source window can be transformed into a larger output window while preserving the game/app input flow and overlay behavior.

## So why "NR"

This app was made in mind to be able to use it with DLSSNR, specifically AMD's versions
you can also use it with optiscaler and reshade to be able to apply those to any game, specially ones with heavy anti cheat solutions
